# üöÄüöÄRotten Fruits Detection Model



## Overview ‚úàÔ∏èüöÄ
This project presents a Rotten Fruits Detection Model, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), saliency map analysis, and class activation mapping. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging the powerful InceptionV3 architecture for transfer learning.

The aim of this project is to develop a robust and accurate system capable of identifying rotten fruits, thereby addressing food waste issues at various stages of the supply chain and consumer levels.

## Key Features
- Utilizes CNN for image classification.
- Incorporates saliency map analysis for identifying important regions in images.
- Implements class activation mapping for visualizing the areas of interest in the input image.
- Employs transfer learning with the InceptionV3 model to leverage pre-trained features.
- Developed with TensorFlow and Keras, along with other supporting libraries.
